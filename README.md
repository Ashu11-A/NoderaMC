# NoderaMC

> **Nodera** — "derived from node; clean, modern, and suitable for an engine or platform."
>
> A NeoForge-based system where the Minecraft world is partitioned into chunk regions, each simulated
> and validated by a small committee of player-run peers, with a dedicated server that starts as the
> coordinator and is progressively demoted to a non-authoritative full archival bootstrap peer.

<!-- AI-AGENT-INSTRUCTION: README.md is a living document. Every commit that completes a task or
     changes test status MUST update: (1) the progress bar below, (2) the module status table,
     (3) Tested.md. Keep comments like this one intact — they guide future agents. See
     .github/ISSUE_SYSTEM.md and AGENTS.md for the full workflow. -->

## Progress

<!-- AI-AGENT-INSTRUCTION: Recompute `overall` as a weighted fraction of the 8 implementation phases
     (Plan §6). Phase 0 pure-Java slice is complete; later phases dominate total effort. Update the
     block count so that filled blocks / 20 ≈ the percentage. Keep the legend. -->

**Overall system completion: `23%`**
`█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░`

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 — Scaffolding | Gradle + pure-Java core/simulation/protocol/consensus/testkit + NeoForge mod skeleton | 🚧 `97%` (mod now wires a live bootstrap peer + the redesigned `/nodera` diagnostics tree + `/noderac` + in-game HUD surfaces + session payload; `runServer`/`runClient` acceptance deferred to a GUI env) |
| Phase 1 — Shadow validation | capture mixins, worker runtime, divergence report | 🚧 `45%` (**determinism pipeline proven headlessly**: new Minecraft-free `shadow-validation` module — `WorkerRuntime` (virtual-thread), `ReplicaStore`, `SnapshotDeltaApplier` (CAS replica advance), `ShadowWorker`/`ShadowCoordinator`, `ServerRecompute` intra-JVM self-check, `DivergenceTracker` + `InterferenceProbe`. `ShadowValidationIT` runs 3 workers × 250 random place/break batches with **zero divergence** and catches a lying worker + re-snapshots. NeoForge capture mixins, live multi-client soak, bandwidth/interference numbers deferred) |
| Phase 2 — Coordinator | leases, epochs, client proposal + server verify | ⬜ `0%` |
| Phase 3 — Committee validation | **MVP gate** (3-client quorum) | ⬜ `0%` |
| Phase 4 — Server fallback only | cross-region router, soak metrics | ⬜ `0%` |
| Phase 5 — Archival bootstrap peer | peer-runtime, event-sourced storage | 🚧 `15%` (`peer-runtime` membership + heartbeat + gateway migration shipped; event-sourced storage pending) |
| Phase 6 — Gateway migration, P2P | libp2p, archival repair, multi-bootstrap | 🚧 `25%` (**P2P continuity beta**: `transport-socket` direct data plane + deterministic gateway migration; base-peer-disconnection continuity proven over real TCP. NAT/libp2p, archival repair, multi-bootstrap pending) |
| Phase 7–8 — Parity program | redstone, environment, mobs, player lane, BFT, mod SDK | ⬜ `0%` |

**Tests:** `277 passing · 0 failing · 0 skipped` (adds **Task 5 Phase 1 shadow validation**: a new Minecraft-free `shadow-validation` module (24 tests) — `WorkerRuntime` lifecycle + off-thread determinism, `SnapshotDeltaApplier` (applied delta re-hashes to the engine root; CAS drift caught), `ReplicaStore` LRU bound, `ShadowWorker` resync semantics, `ServerRecompute` nondeterminism self-check, `DivergenceTracker`/`InterferenceProbe`, and the headless `ShadowValidationIT` (3 workers × 250 random batches, zero divergence + lying-worker catch). See Tested.md).

> **P2P session-continuity beta** (this milestone): two players connect to a NeoForge dedicated
> server acting as a **bootstrap peer**; the mod forms a direct peer mesh over
> `transport-socket`, and when the bootstrap server goes offline the survivors run a **deterministic
> gateway election** and stay connected to each other. The engine is proven headlessly over real TCP
> by `peer-runtime`'s `SessionContinuityIT` (the Nodera debugger's `base-peer-disconnection`
> scenario). The mod compiles and assembles a jar wiring this runtime; `runServer`/`runClient`
> acceptance remains GUI-deferred, consistent with Phase 0.

## Build & test

<!-- AI-AGENT-INSTRUCTION: ALWAYS run `./gradlew check` before committing. Never commit on a red
     build. If a test fails and you cannot fix it immediately, open an issue (see
     .github/ISSUE_SYSTEM.md) and do NOT commit the regression. -->

```bash
./gradlew check                 # compile + all unit tests (the gate)
./gradlew build                 # check + assemble jars
./gradlew :core:test            # one module's tests
./gradlew check --rerun-tasks   # force re-run (ignore up-to-date caching)
```

Host runs JDK **25**; Task 0 pins Java 21. The pure-Java modules use only Java 21-era features
(records, sealed interfaces, virtual threads, pattern matching) so they stay source-compatible when
the 21 toolchain is restored.

## GitHub issue system (how work is tracked)

<!-- AI-AGENT-INSTRUCTION: Treat GitHub issues as the source of truth for what to do next. Open an
     issue for every task AND every detected problem. Full rules: .github/ISSUE_SYSTEM.md. -->

- **Every task is an issue.** The roadmap lives at the GitHub Issues tab, labelled `task`. See
  `.github/ISSUE_SYSTEM.md` for the complete workflow (open / assign / branch / commit / close /
  reopen) and the issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
- **Every detected problem becomes an issue**, labelled `bug`, before (not after) a regression
  reaches `main`.
- **One task = one branch = one PR.** Branch name: `<emoji-less-type>/<short-slug>-#<issue>` e.g.
  `feature/shadow-capture-#5`. Commits cite the issue (`refs #5` while working, `fixes #5` /
  `closes #5` to close).
- **Closing an issue requires**: `./gradlew check` green, README progress + Tested.md updated, the
  task's acceptance criteria linked from the PR description.

See [`.github/ISSUE_SYSTEM.md`](.github/ISSUE_SYSTEM.md) for the normative rules.

## Agent memory & discipline

<!-- AI-AGENT-INSTRUCTION: AGENTS.md is the always-loaded agent memory. The three non-negotiable
     disciplines are: (1) run tests before commit, (2) update README progress + Tested.md, (3) use
     the commit-message standard above. Re-read AGENTS.md at the start of every session. -->

The single source of agent instructions is [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). It is auto-loaded by coding
agents (opencode, Cursor, Claude Code, …) and encodes: build/test commands, layering rules, the
frozen contracts, the test-before-commit / update-README / commit-format disciplines, and the
GitHub issue workflow. **Read it before doing anything.**

A ready-to-paste **base orientation prompt** (which files are load-bearing, the project pattern,
where progress lives, how to open/close issues) lives at
[`docs/Prompt.base.md`](docs/Prompt.base.md).
