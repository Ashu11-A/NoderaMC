# Task 9 — Peer Runtime + Event-Sourced Storage (Phase 5): Full Archival Bootstrap Peer

**Phase:** 5 · **Depends on:** Task 8 · **Modules:** `peer-runtime` (new),
`storage-api`, `storage-rocksdb` (new), `storage-client` (new), `neoforge-mod`,
`consensus`, `protocol`

## Goal

Demote the server. One `PeerRuntime` on every installation; capability-declared roles;
canonical state = certified event log + checkpoints, not "the server's ServerLevel".
Committee of 4, quorum 3-of-4, committee changes certified by their predecessors. The
dedicated server becomes the **full archival bootstrap peer**: stores everything, seeds
everything, votes once. Exit = network-continuity milestone: kill the full peer, the
committees keep committing; it returns and catches up forward.

## Class relationships

```
PeerRuntime (both dists — construction differs only in capabilities + store impl)
 ├─ PeerTransport            (NeoForgeRelayTransport still; Libp2p in Task 10)
 ├─ WorldStore               (RocksWorldStore+FsContentStore | BoundedClientWorldStore)
 ├─ ConsensusRuntime         (consensus module: VoteCollector/QuorumPolicy — quorum now 3-of-4)
 ├─ CommitteeManager         (region committees WITHOUT central assembler authority:
 │                            change = CommitteeChangeProposal signed-off by old committee
 │                            ⇒ CommitteeChangeCertificate; coordinator only *nominates*)
 ├─ ArchiveManager ── ArchivePlacementPolicy (rendezvous; replication: snapshot×5,
 │                            recent log×4, compacted×3, checkpoints+genesis = everyone)
 ├─ PeerDirectory ── BootstrapClient/Service ── CachedPeerStore
 └─ GatewayManager           (registers candidacy only; election is Task 10)

WorldStore (interface — the locked design):
    loadGenesis()/saveGenesis(GenesisManifest)
    latestCheckpoint(RegionId) / storeCheckpoint(RegionCheckpointManifest)
    appendCommittedEvents(RegionId, List<CommittedEventEnvelope>)
    readEvents(RegionId, afterVersion, max)
    storeContent(ContentId, ByteBuffer) / readContent(ContentId)
    storeCertificate(QuorumCertificate)
        ▲                      ▲
   RocksWorldStore        BoundedClientWorldStore

Canonical-state rule (Invariant 3): commit path now writes the event log FIRST
(event + certificate durable in WorldStore) and only then applies to ServerLevel via
DedicatedGatewayAdapter. ServerLevel becomes a VIEW/cache of the log, maintained by the
gateway role — the log, not the level, is what a peer syncs.
```

Checkpointing:

```
Every CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL_TICKS (100) per active region:
  snapshot encode → zstd → ContentId → FsContentStore
  RegionCheckpointManifest{sections as ContentIds, root, certificate} → WorldStore
  log segments before checkpoint become COMPACTABLE (compaction policy: keep last K raw)
```

## Implementation details — server peer (full archival peer)

- **`FullPeerBootstrap`**: builds `PeerRuntime` with full capabilities; wraps the
  existing coordinator services (Tasks 6–8) as the *nomination* source for
  `CommitteeManager` — the server proposes committees (it usually knows load best) but
  a `CommitteeChangeCertificate` requires old-committee approvals (server signature
  counts as one ordinary approval when it sits in the committee). Genesis path: first
  boot with no `GenesisManifest` ⇒ create from current world (extract + checkpoint all
  delegable regions) and self-certify genesis (documented trust root).
- **Commit rewiring**: `QuorumCommitService` → `WorldStore.appendCommittedEvents` +
  `storeCertificate` (RocksDB WriteBatch, fsync policy configurable) → then
  `DedicatedGatewayAdapter.applyDelta` (old applier). Crash between the two ⇒ replay on
  boot: gateway compares last-applied version (chunk attachment, see below) vs log head
  and re-applies missing deltas. **Chunk data attachments** finally land:
  `ModAttachments` registers `NoderaChunkMeta(regionId, committedVersion, rootPrefix,
  lastCheckpointTick)` — persistent chunk attachment; the recovery scan uses it.
- **`ForwardSync`** (returning full peer): compare local vs network checkpoint
  certificates; `local < network` ⇒ fetch manifests → content by hash (multi-seeder,
  Task 10 parallelizes; serial ok here) → verify roots → replay events → resume.
  `local > network-certified` ⇒ local uncertified suffix quarantined (kept, flagged,
  never served). Test both.
- **3-of-4 committees**: `MajorityQuorumPolicy(committeeSize=4, required=3)`; server
  occupies validator seat #3 by default while online (`committee.serverSeat=true` still)
  — a departed server leaves a 3-member committee that still meets 3-of-4? No — quorum
  falls to impossible; `CommitteeManager` immediately drafts a replacement member
  (certified change) or degrades the region to 2-of-3 MVP policy if population is too
  small (`committee.degradedMode=true`, logged loudly). Decision + tests.

## Implementation details — NeoForge mod (client peer)

- `ClientPeerBootstrap`: `PeerRuntime` with `BoundedClientWorldStore`; stores: assigned
  regions (snapshot + recent log), adjacent regions (snapshot), archival shards per
  `ArchivePlacementPolicy`, genesis + latest checkpoints (always).
- Client keeps serving validator/primary exactly as before — the consensus code moved
  under `PeerRuntime` but the worker call-path is unchanged (refactor, not rewrite:
  `RegionWorker`/`ValidatorWorker` now get batches via `PeerRuntime` dispatch).
- `CachedPeerStore` on disk (client game dir) — required for Task 10's
  "discover without the full peer".

## Acceptance criteria

1. Commit durability: kill -9 the server between log-append and world-apply (test hook
   forces the window) ⇒ restart replays the missing delta; chunk attachment version
   catches up; root matches certificate.
2. `ForwardSyncIT` (integration-tests + LoopbackTransport): full peer offline while
   3 fake peers + coordinator-nominee continue committing (server seat degraded mode) ⇒
   full peer returns ⇒ syncs forward ⇒ its store head equals network head, roots
   verified; uncertified local suffix case also covered.
3. **Network-continuity milestone (Plan §6 Phase 5 Milestone B)**: scripted run — kill
   full peer ⇒ committees (4th member drafted from fake peers) keep committing ≥ 10 min
   ⇒ archives intact (replication assertions) ⇒ full peer catch-up verified.
4. Committee-change certificates: every epoch bump in the run above carries approvals
   verifying against the previous committee's keys (walk the chain in the test).
5. Quota: client store hits its byte budget ⇒ eviction order honored ⇒ assigned-region
   data never evicted (unit tests on `ArchiveEvictionPolicy`).
6. RocksDB crash-recovery test (kill during WriteBatch storm ⇒ reopen clean, no torn
   state) and content-store hash verification on read (corrupt a blob file ⇒ read
   rejects).
